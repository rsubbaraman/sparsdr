This application reconstructs signals from SparSDR compressed files. It can be used offline with regular files for input
and output, or in real-time using standard input/standard output or named pipes.

By default, the application assumes that the compressed file was recorded using a USRP N210 using compressed sample
format version 1 with 100 Mhz of bandwidth. It reconstructs the full frequency range using an inverse FFT of size 2048.

There are two supported methods to decompress a smaller range of frequencies.

Method 1: Specify a non-zero center frequency and a number of bins less than 2048. The bins around the center frequency
will be decompressed.

Method 2: Specify one or more decompression bands. If method 2 is used, the center frequency, bins, and destination
arguments must not be provided.
